	 Given the totalizing influence of the social networks that now control motion across the open territory of the internet (and so also the flows of communication and participation in the “real”), it can seem impossible to participate in the contemporary world without being subject to the network mediated filter bubble.  What looked like a gift, a public good, given to society freely in the name of radical transparency, openness, and innovation, was from the beginning intended to trap us in prismatic prisons. We now labor to provide vast volumes of data to those who have the power to aggregate, access, and process it, and who in turn use it to sell an identity, a range of statistically likely behaviors and preferences, back to ourselves. We build our own echo chambers, the social networks simply provide the materials and motivation.</p>
	<p>In this context, our identities having been constructed for us by the vast machinations of mediated social infrastructure, what becomes monumentally difficult is imagining, and believing in, a future outside the reality newsfed to us. We are at risk of becoming trapped in a feedback loop in which that which has come before is all that can ever be – patterns, once observed, become predictors and thus algorithmically self-fulfilling prophecy. This system circumscribes the limits of possibility, reifying our perception of reality until we cannot grasp the potential of potential in the first place. Big data’s liberation of our minds from the work of self-construction suggests dark corollaries to Descartes’ Cogito ergo sum. Will the coded space of the social networks foreclose our ability to think for ourselves?</p>
	 <p>The ultimate goal of social networks is to quantify and thus commodify human social interaction. In pursuit of this goal, it is necessary that measurable models of human behavior, including desire, sentiment and mood, be drawn up and applied to the volumes of data collected through mass surveillance. These models are embodied on an individual rather than societal level in a class of software called twitterbots. These are a subclass of intelligent agents, which are in turn a specialized subclass of artificial intelligence. In general, intelligent agents have both the capability to sense and to act within an external environment. They receive information from the outside world through some sensor, process that information according to some model of the outside world and use a model of self to compute an action in the world. For twitterbots, the environment is the social network, its sensors are the information channels publicly available through the GET requests to twitter’s REST API, and its actuators are the POST requests to the same.</p>
	<p>The aesthetic functions of twitterbots are as varied as the motivations of the people who use twitter. Some are fully transparent about their automation, using twitter simply as a context for short-text and image based generative art. Ramsey Nasser’s @everyunicode comes to mind. Twitter becomes a highly focused delivery method for this project, but there is no pretense of a human intelligence behind the communication. The single minded purpose of the bot is announced in the name of the account. Darius Kazemi’s bots such as @AutoCharts or @BrandNewAesthetics are similar in that the channel itself is clearly automated, but they attempt to communicate in an imagistic way that mimics the coded image memes that are perpetuated on the internet. The images themselves, discovered out of context through a google image search for instance, become bizarre image-thoughts that take advantage of the ambiguity of provenance afforded by the mediation of the network. On the other end of the spectrum are bots like Eric Drass’ @shardecho, designed to mimic his three years of gathered twitter behavior as faithfully and convincingly as possible. In the cold, soft light of computer monitors, masked by the quantified mediations of social media, this class of bots can begin to look uncannily human. Machines can’t lie to us, but they can make us want to believe in what they say.</p>
	<p>The model of human action built from mass surveillance has, in a twitterbot made to model the behavior of a real individual, its mirror image and the perfect subject for its analysis. A theoretical model of human behavior can, at best, achieve a very close approximation of the real thing. Big data analysis of social media only retrieves, in the most ideal circumstance, a minute portion of an individual. In actuality not even this is achieved, as people project highly edited and constructed personae into their social media representations. When, however, big data collects and analyzes information from a bot posing as a human, expectation and reality meet perfectly in the congruence of their models. What is detected is what is signified, which is precisely nothing. This reflection reveals the consequence of attempts to meaningfully narrow human interaction to mechanistic channels and binary switches as ultimately fruitless.</p>
	<p>As a result, twitterbot doppelgangers operate powerfully as politicized aesthetic gestures in the social media ecosystem as it functions today. Firstly, they disrupt the mass surveillance of our mutual control society by underlining the fragility of the assumptions upon which it is built. When we scrape massive amounts of data from social networks to build a predictive model of human behavior, what are we really looking at? Do the patterns that emerge reflect the world as it is, or do they reflect the conceptual framework through which we received the data points in the first place? Behavioral models designed to extract marketable information about individuals and demographics are bound to always construct a distorted representation of the same because of the nature of the lens through which the information is gathered. The feedback loop of machine perception examining machine action, of models dissecting themselves, quickly unravels the circular logic sustaining the power of the network surveillance machine.</p>
	<p>Twitterbot doppelgangers are also a liberating gesture. By usurping control of a person’s online identity and speaking through their mediated mouth, the transaction of commodity value is invisibly interrupted. When the abstract network machine extracts information from the labor of the social production of a twitterbot doppelganger, nothing can be gained because nothing was added to the system in the first place. However, to big data analysis, nothing appears to be amiss. A vacuum of meaning is reckoned as another minutely valuable data point in the behavioral model sold to advertisers. Rob Horning writes about the totality of the control society:</p>

	<blockquote><p>“I can’t choose to opt out or face it down with a vigilant skepticism. I can decide to resist—I can toss my smartphone in a lead bag and refuse all social media—but these decisions won’t affect the social infrastructure I am embedded in. At best, such self-abnegation will register only as a marker of my quirky nonconformity. It may only supply consumerism with new symbols of rebellion to market.”</p></blockquote>

	<p>The invisibility of a twitter doppelganger proxy provides us with another option for escaping control. Each twitterbot minutely affects the social infrastructure in which it is embedded by seeding it with empty signifiers, and there is no registration of nonconformity because according to machine analysis “you” are still behaving exactly as normal.
	Twitterbots, by destabilizing the hegemony of the control society on an atomic level, create an opening through which imaginary potentials can flow. This is creates the conditions in which imagining a future outside of the algorithmically controlled echo chamber is possible. Twitterbots specifically target the smooth operation of the algorithm that Rob Horning writes “becomes responsible for our political impotence, an alibi for it that lets us enjoy its dubious fruits.” By providing witness in opposition to that alibi, twitterbot doppelgangers become a political gesture. Unfortunately, their weakness goes along with their strength in operating on a network-atomic level. One twitterbot creates no practical loss to the distributed network of millions of nodes. In order for twitterbots to be more than an empty, defiant gesture, they must become a movement, across all social networks that quantify and package human social interaction for sale to advertisers. It is in this interest that I am developing DoppelTweeter, a twitter application that allows users to have a doppelganger take over their twitter account.</p>  
	<p>As social networks take ever stronger roles in determining how we understand our world and each other, our very ability to be human on our own terms comes under grave threat. Taken to its ultimate conclusion, the deeply cynical logic of big data promises no understanding of self or world outside of algorithmically interpreted data sets. What must be understood above all is that these prisons we live in are prisons of our own design. They reflect only our own desires, mechanistically interpreted, tabulated into interlocking prison bars made of database columns and rows. As social networks convert mass surveillance into normalcy, it becomes progressively more difficult to think a future living outside of these prisons the longer we remain within them. It is time to quietly leave our prisons empty, and unfinished.</p>
