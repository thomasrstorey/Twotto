Twotto is a twitter bot that automates playbor.

What is this project about? It is about the conflation of labor and leisure. It is a self-defeating disconnection from the network. It is about having your cake and eating it too. In that way it is pharmacological - both poison and cure, and reveals the pharmocological nature of social media. It is also about the value of the qualitative vs the quantitative. I wonder if, in the eyes of big data, a robot and me are quantitatively distinguishable?

What if I show the output of alchemy api analysis on my tweets over time? Expose networked machine vision to human vision - what is the disconnect? Include my "social productivity" stats - number of favorites, retweets, followers over time.

Basic question: What is this "objectivity" to which we have surrendered the evaluation of our social interactions?
