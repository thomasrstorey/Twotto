Twotto is a twitter bot that automates playbor.

What is this project about? It is about the conflation of labor and leisure. It is a self-defeating disconnection from the network. It is about having your cake and eating it too. In that way it is pharmacological - both poison and cure, and reveals the pharmocological nature of social media. It is also about the value of the qualitative vs the quantitative. I wonder if, in the eyes of big data, a robot and me are quantitatively distinguishable?

What if I show the output of alchemy api analysis on my tweets over time? Expose networked machine vision to human vision - what is the disconnect? Include my "social productivity" stats - number of favorites, retweets, followers over time.

Basic question: What is this "objectivity" to which we have surrendered the evaluation of our social interactions?

The politics of twitterbots.

Mechanization and mediation of social interaction is to serve machine analysis of our lives - the hypothesis is, if we constrain human emotion to a few quantifiable measures, perhaps we can build a quantifiable model of social dynamics.
A lot of people are justifiably angry at Facebook over the recent psychological study they conducted by controlling the emotional content of what reached certain users' feeds. They should be angry about this all the time though - Facebook is always controlling what comes to your facebook feed, 24/7. They just normally do it on the basis of what they think you would like to see. 
Facebook and twitter make the fatal assumption that people, by and large, communicate at face value what they are feeling across social networks such as theirs.
This is the assumption that machine analysis of mediated interaction operates on, and this machine analysis provides the basis for the economic value that these social networks represent.
A twitter bot is a rejoinder to this hypothesis - I provide the perfect, mechanical, social participant that always says "exactly what it means to say". There is nothing below face value for a machine to say, and the machine analysis of what the machine says reveals only a void of meaning. The turn is in the contrast with what we see as humans. When a machine speaks, we want to believe and we suspend disbelief to imagine agency for these voices. The mediation of twitter exacerbates this, giving human and machine voice exactly the same appearance, leveling the uncanny valley.
The interaction of machine content producers and machine content readers reveals us to be more complex than our machines give us credit for - the machines only have power in so far as we give it to them.
